Patched version of moona cooling pillow pad android app that can be used offline.

I know it's been years since moona shut down and this might not be useful to many people but I have been playing around with hacking android apps and I was able to hack the moona app to get it working again with my moona.
Here are the instructions:

- If you have the moona app currently installed, uninstall it.
- Download and Install [moona_5.8.7_patched1.apk](https://github.com/garbb/moona_app/releases/download/1/moona_5.8.7_patched1.apk)
- Run the app and tap the log in button
- Leave the username and password blank and tap log in
- Now you should be able to click the bluetooth icon and connect your moona
- once you have verified this works, install [moona_5.8.7_patched1_offline_upgrade.apk](https://github.com/garbb/moona_app/releases/download/1/moona_5.8.7_patched1_offline_upgrade.apk)
- run the app again and connect to your moona at least once
- now the moona app should be able to work totally offline
- if you ever see the bluetooth icon on the top-left turn red just tap it and try to connect again

Let me know if this works for you since I haven't tried it with any other phone or moona unit other than my own.

Running the first app (moona_5.8.7_patched1.apk) does require internet access as I got it working by pointing it to a server that I set up, but once you install the moona_5.8.7_patched1_offline_upgrade.apk it should then work totally offline just as long as you don't uninstall it or clear the app data. I can provide instructions for anyone who wants to know how to get it working without the server I set up.
